// What is JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a client-side scripting language initially known as "LiveScript." It was later rebranded as JavaScript due to Java's popularity at the time. It is designed to make web pages interactive and "alive" by allowing actions to be performed programmatically within the page.

// Capabilities of JavaScript
// JavaScript is versatile and can run on both the client and server sides, making it one of the most widely used languages. Here are its capabilities:

// In-Browser JavaScript: It can manipulate HTML via the DOM, respond to events, manage AJAX requests, handle cookies, and use local storage.
// Limitations: It operates under strict permissions, preventing access to low-level CPU operations and the local file system without user permissions, ensuring user security. The same-origin policy restricts cross-site AJAX requests.
// Unique Aspects of JavaScript
// JavaScript is unique because of its full integration with HTML and CSS and its ability to utilize APIs easily. Most browsers support JavaScript by default, and disabling it can limit website functionality.

// JavaScript Versions
// JavaScript is constantly updated through the ECMAScript (ECMA) standard, first introduced in 1997, ensuring its evolution to meet modern programming needs.
