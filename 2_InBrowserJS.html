<!-- Adding JavaScript
JavaScript can be placed either in the <head> or at the end of the <body> tag. Placing it at the end of <body> ensures the DOM is fully loaded before JavaScript executes, preventing potential issues with elements not yet available in the DOM.

Output: Open your HTML file in a browser, then open the developer console (e.g., Ctrl + Shift + J on Chrome) to view "Hello world" in the console log.

Using the Developer Console
The console is a powerful tool for debugging and viewing output in JavaScript. It shows:
Output logs from console.log()
    Errors in JavaScript code
    AJAX request statuses and responses
    Variable values and states at different execution points -->
